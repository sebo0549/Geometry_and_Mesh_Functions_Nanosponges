# Geometry_and_Mesh_Functions_Nanosponges

This repository contains functions for handling and editing STL files, which are used for processing nanosponge geometries. In addition, geometric properties are calculated and the required files for the creation of anisotropic sponges in Comsol are provided.  
  
# How to use

1. Copy your STL-file into the subfolder 'STLs' in the folder '2_Inputfiles' 
2. Run one of the six main functions in folders '3_...' to '8_...'. . A subfolder for the results is automatically created in each folder. In order for this function to be executed, the file name of the STL file must still be adapted in the respective function.

Coordinates shall be in micrometers. In addition, the sponge geometries should be aligned along the xy-plane. 

A description of the respective functions is given at the beginning of each file. In addition, sample files are already included in the folder with the input files. The main functions can thus be executed directly after the download.
